      <description>The Rabbit and The Turtle We all have heard of this Aesop &amp;ldquo;The Rabbit and The Turtle&amp;quot;. It is a story where a turtle despite being slow challenges rabbit for a race and rabbit out of overconfidence, stop to take a nap and lost it.
The moral behind this story was &amp;ldquo;Slow and Steady wins the race&amp;rdquo;.
Most of you must have heard this story only up to here, let me tell you my friends, it was just a trailer.</description>
