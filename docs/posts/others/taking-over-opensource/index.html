        <p>I was having a discussion with #dgplug member @thebigj (jaisinh) on Google events like devfest @pyconindia 2017 in Delhi and I realised something I never thought of before.</p>
<p>His point of view on google events is that the google events/meetups donot feel like an open source collaborators and new enthusiasts but rather a marketting strategy by google to feed all the new developers the wrong wolf. Since every students is inspired by the name of google and the invite based system creates the hype and helps them to fall in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Later, I think about our discussion and I have suggestions / views regarding the discussion too as following,</p>
<p>The google events / meetups are nothing more than a mere advertisement, mostly.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that the google meetups are bad or something, it&rsquo;s jsut that they convey the right meaning to new members of an opensource community and because of the programme like GSoC, many contributors work only for the money they get. It is true that GSoC helped many communities find their next heir, but general trend suggests (atleast in developing nations) that money matters more than community.</p>
<p>In my own experience, I had the least networking with the total strangers in google events, as everyone is busy flaunting their skills and not sharing the knowledge as it should be in a progressive community.</p>
<p>Note: Please be free to share your opinion if you feel something wrong about my views. They are all my personal views and no one shall be responsible for the awareness except @thebigj ofcourse :D and this is just a warning towards the future of open source.</p>
