      <description>October is the month of open source for me. Want to know why? In this blog post, I am going to share my Open Source Experience in the month of October 2018, when attended, Open Source Summit Europe 2018, Scotlug meetup and MozFest Festival as well :)
This blog post is a long due, waiting in my draft for ages, for me to complete it and hit publish. Last year, in the month of October, I got to experience the most out of the Open Source Culture so far.</description>
