      <description>Celebrating #ilugdelhi anniversary last year was more fun than any celebration we ever had. What did we do? You ask. We solved puzzles, hurdled through challenges and did the treasure hunting. The winners get goodies, a rucksack, calendar and stickers.
So what&amp;rsquo;s the plan?
Like all our meetups, we try to add a little fun in our meetups and in this one, we outdid ourselves. Thanks to all the volunteers who helped.</description>
