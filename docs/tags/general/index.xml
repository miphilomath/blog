      <description>My voice! We all have something to say and share our views with others, right? We all want to speak our opinions without any hesitation, and share our point of view, don&amp;rsquo;t we? And still, at times we don&amp;rsquo;t share everything we want to. We all have something to say, don&amp;rsquo;t we? And we all speak our feelings, our emotions whenever we want to share something with someone, right?</description>

      <description>Let the past be in past!
If you are looking for posts older than the ones present here? You can find them at https://phi2infinity.blogspot.in. All the older posts will be updated there only. I may or may not migrate the posts back to this website. Meanwhile all my writings are compiled at one place on github.
To know more, read the moving announcement here.
I am listing down all the posts available there with their title and the hyperlink to the original blog.</description>
