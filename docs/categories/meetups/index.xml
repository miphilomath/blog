      <description>Today, I attended my very first meetup PyDelhi. So I am going to share my experience about the meetup with you all.

I woke up early to reach there on time and voila, like everything, we want nothing goes wrong with, and then there it is, boom. I got late, I don’t know how but on reaching the venue I found I was much early.</description>
