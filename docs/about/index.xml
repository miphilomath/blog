      <description>This page is created to answer the most obnoxious question everyone ask each other, what are you doing now-a-days?
I am creating these page after getting inspired from Derek Sivers. I will update this regularly with the last updated date on the top about my current professional work, personal projects, plans and books I have been reading. You can consider this page a live journal about myself.
After my graduation, I joined SFLC.</description>

      <description>Nice to see you here and thank you for showing interest to know me. To know what I have been doing these days, visit my Now page.
Philomath! Yes, a philomath. A single word that describes me and my thirst for knowledge. Philomath originates from combining 2 greek words, &amp;ldquo;Philos and &amp;ldquo;math&amp;rdquo; that means, &amp;ldquo;lover of learning&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;knowledge seeker&amp;rdquo;.
Languages I am multi-lingual and can speak a lot of languages, ranging from human comprehensible to computer languages.</description>
