        <p>Libre boot is an open-source BIOS firmware aimed to make your system free from binary blobs.</p>
<p>My mentor Shaktikannan aka mbuf, guided me throughout the project and motivated me to get started with it.</p>
<p>He told me install it first on test computer and to be honest, It was not  as easy as installing any regular softwares to your system. It was way  more difficult to install it, mainly because on the fact, I was too  afraid to mess up even my test computer.</p>
<p>So I bought a  rpi, in hope that I can work on the bios firmware of rpi. But to my  surprise, rpi has very different mechanism of booting and its Bios  firmware is another binary blob.</p>
<p>WIth not documentation or resource to replace my rpi bios firmware, I finally planned to work  on test computer. But as I was going through the libre boot  documentations, I found something about Qemu.</p>
<p>Then I  started reading about it and then, I was surprised to see that I can  install libre boot on Qemu: A type-1 hypervisor. Now, here starts my  journey to hypervisor, and libre boot.</p>
<p>Next blog on Hypervisor and virtual machine.</p>
