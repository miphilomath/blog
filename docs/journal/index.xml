      <description>Stuck in the past with the dreams and questions, What if?
Physics, computers, parents and my talent if nurtured. The wasted 4 years which wasn&amp;rsquo;t wasted only if I could get a job in that field, which I would be happy to study as a passion/hobby and pass time developing open source softwares. But only if I had a job, satisfying my intellectual challenge.
And now with everything going off the mark, I am going back in time and stuck with my could be dreams.</description>
