      <description>Now, I am proud to be an hacker, especially knowing after how this hacker culture developed. Well, I am a part of a revolution, Hacker Revolution and I am very excited to be its part.
We had this session on an IRC channel #dgplug, which is a part of their summer training programme, and seriously what a great session it was. I still feel pumped up as if I was there by myself.</description>
