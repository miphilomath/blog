      <description>Prelogue!
Last Year i.e., 2019, I gifted myself a lot of books from amazon, the ones I have been recommened by others and I was planning to read soon. And, only an year after I got the time to pick the book, I was most excited to read. It&amp;rsquo;s not I didn&amp;rsquo;t read in the meanwhile, I bought more books and piled them over this one. This year, I am on a streak of reading atleast 1 book a month and i selected Quiet, the power of introverts for the month of May, which I picked after watching the Ted talk by Susan Cain, the author of this amazing book.</description>
