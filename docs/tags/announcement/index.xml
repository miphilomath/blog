      <description>My voice! We all have something to say and share our views with others, right? We all want to speak our opinions without any hesitation, and share our point of view, don&#39;t we? And still, at times we don&#39;t share everything we want to. We all have something to say, don&#39;t we? And we all speak our feelings, our emotions whenever we want to share something with someone, right?
But at times, based on the situation, either we don&#39;t put forward our feelings, our views and stays silent, which is by the way, not good.</description>
