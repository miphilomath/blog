      <description>Learning is copying!
We learn by copying others&amp;rsquo; work, patterns and make new patterns using the knowledge gained by mimicing others.
Learning is what keeps us alive. Learning is one of the many things that gives the unique identity we have with the skills, we learned so far in our life, our behavior, mindset and logical reasoning skills gained throughout our life, consciously or otherwise. It might be one of the things that makes us who we are, make us human, make us alive.</description>
