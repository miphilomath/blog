        <p>On normal winter days of January, planning for Google summer of code  2018, targeting organizations, narrowing my projects that I want to  contribute to.</p>
<p>Luckily, Delhi University&rsquo;s credible college  Cluster Innovation Center initiated a programme &ldquo;Cluster Month of Code&rdquo;  abbreviated as CMoC for the whole month of February 2018.</p>
<p>Mostly Inspired by IIIT allahabad&rsquo;s programme Opencode, CIC took this  initiative and I registered, as I did to OpenCode. But due to lack of my time management skills, which is improving daily, I couldn&rsquo;t dedicate  my time to any project and thus, missed opencode opportunity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I managed to work along CMoC on the assigned project of GIT, a very  credible distributed version control system written by the father of  linux kernel himself in very few days. [Link to its history].</p>
<p>Fortunately, git has good amount of documentation to read, to learn more about. They discuss everything on their mailing lists and are very active on their  irc channel #git on freenode server as well.</p>
<p>My Journey:</p>
<p>\1. Subscribe to Mailing list as the first step to discuss, be part of the  contribution discussion. That&rsquo;s the very first step to be a part of an  open source project contribution, watching the discussion, and be a part of the discussion.</p>
<p>For the mailing list, it might not be easy  for someone new to this field, because every mailing list especially,  upstream projects have certain guidelines that need to be followed.  These guidelines are very important for the conversation to be conducted in controlled manner so that it would be easy for others to read and  understand the mail.</p>
<p>Though, each mailing list has  different guidelines, but there are certain guidelines that are  universal, that everyone should know about and for this, read the  mailing list guidelines by shaktimaan.[link to his guidelines.]</p>
<p>Short summary of the mailing list guidelines:</p>
<p>* Don&rsquo;t use messaging language, use full word and write the message in words as simple as possible.</p>
<p>* Never do a top posting on a mailing list, because it creates a discontinuity in the flow of text.</p>
<p>* Be patient for someone to answer and be humble as possible. After all, no one is working for anyone and still helping you.</p>
<p>\2. Read the project developer guide, documentation and contribution guidelines.</p>
<p>\3. Fork/Clone the project repository on your system and set up the working environment for you to work on.</p>
<p>\4. Install the software from the sources keeping the system version intact to not affect your daily work.</p>
<p>NOTE: Careful while installing any software from sources, and try not to  break the system installed software to keep your work unaffected.</p>
<p>I installed git in /usr/local/bin directory so that, my global system installed git will not be affected.</p>
<p>But first of all, to install any software from source in linux, you need to install dev tools using: `sudo apt install libssl-dev  &amp;&amp;</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp">sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
</code></pre></div><p>` (Don&rsquo;t copy paste any linux commands from third-party sites.[link to my blog]</p>
<p>Only then, you will be able to install any software from source.</p>
<p>PS: This was my first challenge towards contributing to any upstream project.</p>
<p>\4. Try to understand the project structure and code. Ask for help if  needed. This step takes some time, because having an ability to read  boring yet very important documentation is a bliss and takes time to  acquire.</p>
<p>\5. NEVER QUIT! I understand, it happened to me too. You might feel frustated, and lose your motivation to work on it  any longer. But don&rsquo;t quit so easily, if it would be that easy, everyone would be doing it :P.</p>
<p>Quoting my friend, learning is never easy but can be fun if you feel motivated enough towards it.</p>
