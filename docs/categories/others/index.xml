      <description>Naruto vs Dragon Ball Z! Yes, You guessed it right. It&amp;rsquo;s the comparison between naruto vs Dragon Ball Z in the world of anime. It is true that even though most of you have already watched Naruto, Naruto Shippuden and Boruto, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even finished my Naruto series. But now I regret, why I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch this amazing series that pumps my blood even in the most sensual, non-action scenes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch Naruto before because of its reputation of very lengthy series and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to Torrent Download or Torrent Stream these many episodes (I try to avoid torrenting as much as possible).</description>

      <description>My voice! We all have something to say and share our views with others, right? We all want to speak our opinions without any hesitation, and share our point of view, don&amp;rsquo;t we? And still, at times we don&amp;rsquo;t share everything we want to. We all have something to say, don&amp;rsquo;t we? And we all speak our feelings, our emotions whenever we want to share something with someone, right?
But at times, based on the situation, either we don&amp;rsquo;t put forward our feelings, our views and stays silent, which is by the way, not good.</description>
