        <p>Ever installed any software in you linux based operating system? Yes? So might have installed it using one of the two methods, either by  using your system package manager, or by downloading and installing  .deb/.rpm packages.</p>
<p>So, installing software in linux can be done in 2 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using system package manager, which apt for debian based or dnf for redhat based operating system by <code>apt install &lt;software&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Using .deb or .rpm packages downloaded from the software respective website by <code>apt install &lt;.deb file&gt;</code></li>
</ol>
<p>So, how does these methods work, and what are the differences  between them? Before finding answers to above questions, let&rsquo;s find more about on basics.</p>
<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
<p>Each and every software depends on various other  softwares, programs or libraries (dependencies), that is required by  that software to function properly and to install any software we need  to install all those dependent softwares and libraries as well. For  users, installing these many dependent softwares could be frustrating  and there has to be some way to install software easily, so that they  can dedicate their time more on their work rather than configuring and  installing the required software.Software packages ease the process of  installing software on your system so that user can do his work on the  software not waste time on its installation.</p>
<p>Packages contain meta data, such as the software&rsquo;s name, description of its purpose, version number, vendor, checksum, and a list of dependencies necessary for the software to run properly.</p>
<p>So, in short, software packages or packages is like packing the software  itself and all its dependent softwares in single file known as package  with extensions .deb or .rpm depending on the package manager it uses.</p>
<h3 id="package-manager">Package Manager</h3>
<p>Never heard of package manager?</p>
<p>Package Managers are softwares that manages software packages, automates the  process of installing, upgrading, configuring and removing computer  programs in a consistent manner (i.e. in a way that don&rsquo;t leave your  system in an inoperable state and handles installation of all dependent  software by itself).</p>
<p>Upon installation, meta data is stored in a local package database.  Package managers maintain a database of software dependencies and  version information to prevent software mismatches and missing  prerequisites. On Debian based operating system, &ldquo;aptitude&rdquo; package  manager is used while Red hat based operating system uses RPM.</p>
<h3 id="difference-between-both-the-installation-methods">Difference between both the installation methods!</h3>
<p>Ultimately, in both the methods, software is installed using the software packaged  for the operating system i.e. .deb or .rpm file</p>
<p>So, why use two different methods? Where is the .deb file while installing  from official repository? What is the advantage of one over other? Calm  down! We will find answers to all these questions.</p>
<p>First, both methods are used for different purpose</p>
<p>Second, the software installed using official repository downloads the software package for that particular software from that operating system  official repository, and then installed later on.</p>
<p>those .deb files are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives directory of your operating system.</p>
