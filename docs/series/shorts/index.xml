      <description>When someone says, they have mastered some skill/concept/subject and agrees, that they are perfect in that particular domain. They are wrong!
There is always some scope for improvement. We can always improve our skills, knowledge, personality, projects and everything. But how do one know where is one lacking and needs improvement? How can one tell if they have really mastered something?
That is simple. Answer the most simple questions we avoid on daily basis and you will know if you really understand the thing you think you know.</description>
