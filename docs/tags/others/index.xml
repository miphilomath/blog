      <description>You might all know, that there was an era when people do shitty ceremonies to praise their gods like sacrificing and all. And you must be thinking, only a fool can think so. Then you are wrong, everyone including you and me, are fool enough to do same shitty things when it comes to thing that we don&amp;rsquo;t understand.

Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not any theory, but one thing that I believe might be the reason.</description>
