      <description>Prelogue! Last Year i.e., 2019, I gifted myself a bundle of books waiting in my amazon shopping cart to be checked out accumulating over time by the suggestions of my friends and my reading list, on my birthday. But the year was a little busy for me and lot of books to read in such a less time and it took me an year before I got the time to pick the book, I was most excited to read.</description>

      <description>This page is created to answer the most obnoxious question everyone ask each other, what are you doing now-a-days?
I am creating these page after getting inspired from Derek Sivers. I will update this regularly with the last updated date on the top about my current professional work, personal projects, plans and books I have been reading. You can consider this page a live journal about myself.
After my graduation, I joined SFLC.</description>

      <description>Try and execute the following script in your bash terminal:
:(){ :|:&amp;amp; };: Hold up!
 If you execute the above statement on your terminal it will result in fork bombing your system resulting into a total shutdown of your system. If you executed the above script, there is nothing to worry about. It&amp;rsquo;s no hack. Though above script is commonly used in Denial-Of-Service attack.
So what just happened?
The above script executed a function over and over until all your system resources were exhausted leaving no memory (one of the critical requirement for any process to work, including your operating system.</description>

      <description>If you have a keen eye like me, you must have noticed the categories and tags in each post and may even wonder, what this categories mean or what type of post are compiled in each category. I decided to write another post on helping the curiosity about categories and ease the exploration. Another reason to write this article is to help myself, to be consistent with the categories I use with my blog posts.</description>

      <title>Learning is more than passing Exams!</title>

      <description>Learning is copying!
We learn by copying others&amp;rsquo; work, patterns and make new patterns using the knowledge gained by mimicing others.
Learning is what keeps us alive. Learning is one of the many things that gives the unique identity we have with the skills, we learned so far in our life, our behavior, mindset and logical reasoning skills gained throughout our life, consciously or otherwise. It might be one of the things that makes us who we are, make us human, make us alive.</description>

      <description>All coders/programmers are night owlers and prefer coffee to sustain the whole night. And here is something interesting for everyone who sustains on coffee. There is a special protocol made for all programmers whose primary Energy drink is coffee, named Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with, what is this coffee protocol?
Rationale The rationale for making a standard protocol for all coffee driven programmers is too connect all these coffee pots along with their hosts (programmers) with each other using Internet.</description>

      <description>Naruto vs Dragon Ball Z! Yes, You guessed it right. It&amp;rsquo;s the comparison between naruto vs Dragon Ball Z in the world of anime. It is true that even though most of you have already watched Naruto, Naruto Shippuden and Boruto, I haven&amp;rsquo;t even finished my Naruto series. But now I regret, why I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch this amazing series that pumps my blood even in the most sensual, non-action scenes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch Naruto before because of its reputation of very lengthy series and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to Torrent Download or Torrent Stream these many episodes (I try to avoid torrenting as much as possible).</description>

      <description>My voice! We all have something to say and share our views with others, right? We all want to speak our opinions without any hesitation, and share our point of view, don&amp;rsquo;t we? And still, at times we don&amp;rsquo;t share everything we want to. We all have something to say, don&amp;rsquo;t we? And we all speak our feelings, our emotions whenever we want to share something with someone, right?
But at times, based on the situation, either we don&amp;rsquo;t put forward our feelings, our views and stays silent, which is by the way, not good.</description>

      <description>Here you will find the projects I am working on or have worked on. I don&amp;rsquo;t have much to showcase other than my blog over here because many of side projects, I started to learn a new skill are still incomplete. I will update them here once I pick them again and finish what I&amp;rsquo;ve started. Or, I will publish few of the ideas of my side projects which you can pick up to learn a new skill.</description>

      <description>Nice to see you here and thank you for showing interest to know me. To know what I have been doing these days, visit my Now page.
Philomath! Yes, a philomath. A single word that describes me and my thirst for knowledge. Philomath originates from combining 2 greek words, &amp;ldquo;Philos and &amp;ldquo;math&amp;rdquo; that means, &amp;ldquo;lover of learning&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;knowledge seeker&amp;rdquo;.
Languages I am multi-lingual and can speak a lot of languages, ranging from human comprehensible to computer languages.</description>

      <description>Stuck in the past with the dreams and questions, What if?
Physics, computers, parents and my talent if nurtured. The wasted 4 years which wasn&amp;rsquo;t wasted only if I could get a job in that field, which I would be happy to study as a passion/hobby and pass time developing open source softwares. But only if I had a job, satisfying my intellectual challenge.
And now with everything going off the mark, I am going back in time and stuck with my could be dreams.</description>
