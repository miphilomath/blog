<p>8th july 2017 is the day when I attended my very first meetup of pydelhi or any in general. Thanks to #dgplug folks and <a href="https://www.sanyamkhurana.com/#/recommendations">@curiouslearner</a>. And now a year later, we had another <a href="https://pydelhi.org/">pydelhi meetup</a> on the exact date which marks my one year annniversary with delhi open  source community. This post is going to be lengthy, so grab your  popcorn!</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s start with the details and experience of this annual meetup of mine.</p>
<h3 id="prologue">Prologue</h3>
<p>Last year, I joined #dgplug summer training on IRC: freenode. Being new  to open source world, I found it very amusing to have some delhites on  the training whom I could meet in person. On 8th July 2017, I attended  my first meetup of any community in-person. I wrote a blog post of that  meetup sharing my experience <a href="https://phi2infinity.blogspot.com/2017/07/my-first-meetup-pydelhi.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction!</h3>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/ChampionShutler">championshuttler</a> and I reached the venue, there were around 100 people already present  at the venue (which happens to be Microsoft&rsquo;s Delhi Office at Gurugram). Introductions were going on.</p>
<p>Since I have attended many meetups since last year, I saw many familiar faces in the crowd.</p>
<p>After Introductions, we had a furious discussion on &ldquo;Text Editors vs  IDEs&rdquo; where pros and cons were listed and many of us got a clear picture on what to use when.</p>
<h3 id="tex-editors-vs-ides-integrated-development-environment">&ldquo;Tex Editors vs IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)!&rdquo;</h3>
<p>To summarize a little, Editors help you gain implementation level  knowledge of the tech stack i.e. using editors, you as a programmer will be more aware of the program construct (indentation, classes et al.)  and will better understand your code. On the contrary, IDE&rsquo;s provide  auto-complete suggestions, and are generally helpful in production level environment when you have gained knowledge and need efficiency. You  should always start with the editors and with time and experience,  switch to IDE (Integrated Development Environment).</p>
<p>(I proudly use Vim Text Editor! Another post on my Vim experience, coming soon!)</p>
<h3 id="networking-session">Networking session</h3>
<p>The best part of any community gathering a.k.a meet-up is the networking break where we get to meet different people, hear about their amazing  ideas and projects. Even you are shy to interact with anyone (like me),  you learn a lot just by listening.</p>
<h3 id="becoming-a-multilingual-superhero-in-django---by-sanyam-khurana">Becoming a multilingual superhero in Django &ndash;by <em>Sanyam Khurana</em></h3>
<p>Ever been in a situation where you had to support multiple languages  with your django website? This talk will surely help you out. The  original proposal of the talk can be found <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/becoming-a-multilingual-superhero-in-django~bkMve/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="managing-dotfiles-using-python---by-vipul-gupta">Managing Dotfiles using Python &ndash;by Vipul Gupta</h3>
<p>Is it a head ache for you to recreate dot files every time your system  breaks down or you switch distributions? If yes, this talk will surely  help which uses python library <em>&ldquo;Homely&rdquo;.</em> Original talk proposal can be found <a href="https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2018/proposals/keeping-your-dotfiles-in-check-with-python~dw7Xd/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="time-for-lightning-bolt">Time for Lightning Bolt!</h3>
<p>At every meet-up, we have lightning talk sessions where anyone from  attendee can showcase their project, represent their community and share whatever they want. And so, we have a Debian packaging lightening  session by <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ManasKashyap">Manas Kashyap</a>.</p>
<h3 id="shout-out">Shout Out!</h3>
<p>People from various communities pitched about their community. We had community pitching from <a href="http://www.linuxdelhi.org/">Ilugd</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PyLadiesDelhi">PyLadies Delhi</a>, <a href="https://pydelhi.org/">Pydelhi</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxchix.org/">LinuxChix India</a> et al.</p>
<p>Also, If you feel sad about missing all the interesting talks. Don&rsquo;t worry, we recorded it all and will update the link as soon  as they are published. The official blog post by Pydelhi can be found <a href="https://pydelhi.org/blog/pydelhi-meetup-08-july-2018.html">here</a> and photos from the meet-up are uploaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cGF4bxhseEvYylF2PKlrMmp7WbQKoSvf">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="not-over-yet">Not over yet!</h4>
<p>After these amazing talks and networking, some of us stayed at the  venue. I was doing what I love the most, more networking. We talked  about <a href="https://hillhacks.in/about/">hill hacks</a>, <a href="https://www.debconf.org/">DebConf</a>, hacking (in the true sense), repairing each others&rsquo; systems, sharing  cool stickers etc. In the midst of these enlightening sessions, I even  found a resolution to my thorny Apache problem; which was basically  installing a missing module and enabling the firewall. Thank you [isagar](<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/I">https://wiki.debian.org/I</a> Sagar).</p>
<p>Also, we did some rubix puzzle solving, system breaking session and played xbox as well :)</p>
<p>I also learned about editing grub while booting by [isagar](<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/I">https://wiki.debian.org/I</a> Sagar). Another post on this, later.</p>
<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I have joined these open source communities in Delhi and have attended  many meet-ups during the course. I learn something new at every meet-up,  meet new people and make new friends. These community meet-ups make up  most of my social interaction (Being shy and introverted, I tend to sit  and watch others). These sessions have taught me to open up to new people, have  conversation and so on. They also taught me many new skills and as we say  at #dgplug,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learn together, Teach others!</p>
