    <p>This page is created to answer the most obnoxious question everyone ask each other, what are you doing now-a-days?</p>
<p>I am creating this page after getting inspired from <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">Derek Sivers</a>. I will update this regularly with the last updated date on the top about my current professional work, personal projects, plans and books I have been reading. You can consider this page a live journal about myself.</p>
<p>After my graduation, I joined SFLC.in as an intern for the past six months, which is now over. I learned many new things working at SFLC.in. As a technologist, I was exposed to lot of tools they were using. I learned Django. As of now, I am looking for job, as you might have read on my about page and ATS is making me crazy.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, I am trying to be more discipline than I used to be, made a schedule to follow with all the stuff I want to do, and I hope with a proper schedule I can balance all of them, like a good scheduler handling multiple processes. I am working on Django based Internet tracker for SFLC.in as a side help, improving my skills, reading a lot of books and applying atleast at 2 companies in a day.</p>
<p>And, I plan to start blog posts with weekly update on what I did this week, what books I read and the progress with my work if any.</p>
<p>I soon, plan to start the documentation for Dhwani. I applied for the Hey.com email account and my volunteer application for Digital Grassroots foundation and it got rejected.</p>
<p><del>I will start working as a Subject Matter Expertise (SME) by the end of this week or this month at most during the night hours.</del> I have been applying for positions at many places and getting my applications rejected at almost everywhere I am hearing back from. So, I decided to work for whatever job I could find, which is SME in this case. This was not my plan to work as a SME and alas, I couldn&rsquo;t find a job as a developer or DevOps engineer, this will keep me sane for a while and help me hone my basics in the domain. <del>So if my volunteer application gets through, I will be working as a volunteer for the organisation along with my night job as SME and contribute to OSS project based on my GSoD proposal.</del> To prepare myself for the interviews in the future and crack the job that I want, I will solve 1 question of competitive platforms in a week along with the side projects I will work on. Because I don&rsquo;t want to just, code, but develop the software like a professional software developer does.</p>
<p>Well they are not replying about the application after confiming every thing, which only suggests that they don&rsquo;t want to hire. So the plan failed. This puts me in a depressed mood and now I decide to finally prepare for the GATE exam once and for all, which will definitely help me with interviews and solve the questions when I get time.</p>
<p>I am planning to drop out of my IGNOU course for BSC Physics because of my inability to dedicate enough time and study with concentration along with the interview prep (at which I am failing very badly) even with my extreme interest for theoretical physics and space.</p>
<p><del>By the end of this week, I will pick one of the OSS project and organisation to which I will dedicate my time. The basis for the selection will be the community support, skills I want to learn and use, and the purpose of the project. My interest in Physics, documentation and GSoD organisation will be considered as well.</del></p>
<p>I got the invite for hey.com yesterday on 24th June and I did a write up on the features hey.com is providing, so do check it out here.</p>
<p>I am gonna give it a go with fiverr, a freelancing platform and will update anything here, worthwhile. I will also start doing more art like I used to as a kid and write some good book reviews which I can use a source of passive income.</p>
