        <p>In this blog post, we will learn about what a process is, in computing context and how operating system is responsible for managing the multiple processes running in the system to use the computer hardware (processor and peripherals) optimally.</p>
<p>Operating system is a very sophisticated and critical software that enables the user to use their computer most efficiently. Users run their program / tools on the computers by executing a set of instructions to achieve an output. But computer cannot execute program directly, and needs the help of operating system to do so. When a user executes a program, a process is created to perform the task and is managed by operating system to use the computer hardware most efficiently among various such processes.</p>
<!-- A more detailed description on operating system, types of operating system and evolution of the same can be found here. (Reference to another blog post) How computers were large monsters, with manual switches to execute the instructions, the task people used to perform are now done by operating system. Especially useful in muli-tasking and multiuser operating system. -->
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Computer (processors) needs to load the programs in primary memory i.e. RAM in order to execute or run them</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-process">
  What is a process?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#what-is-a-process">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>So, what is a process? Everyone who wants to understand how things work on your computer and how operating system works should be able to explain what a process is.</p>
<p>By definition, process is a piece of software (computer program) that is under execution by your computer. But what happens when a program is under execution? When a program is executed by your computer, the program is loaded into the primary memory with which your processor (CPU) interacts with to perform the task (instructions) defined in the program code.</p>
<p><strong>What else?</strong></p>
<p>Program code is only a small textual part of the process. Along with program code, much more information is loaded into the memory (RAM) for it to be executed by the processor. Process includes details required to manage and keep track of all the instructions and variables used by the process, in order to help the operating system manage them efficiently. Process also includes its current state, memory usage, input/output status and much more. In summary, process contains the following details and more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Program instructions (written in any computer readable language)</li>
<li>Program counter and instruction pointer, to keep track of its current status</li>
<li>Stack, contains the temporary data such as function parameters, return addresses and local variables.</li>
<li>Data section, to store global variables.</li>
<li>Heap, memory space that is dynamically allocated at run time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Program code only acts as a blueprint for the process and one program can be used by two or more processes at the same time. You can read more at <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html?highlight=process_">Linux Kernel docs</a> to know the different details Linux kernel keeps track of.</p>
<p>More accurately, process is a program code loaded into memory along with the program counter, stack, heap, data sections etc. to be executed by the processor.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Process loaded in memory can also be referred as &ldquo;process context&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://theknowledgeseeker.in/posts/images/process_in_memory.png" alt="process-in-memory"></p>
<h3 id="process-control-block">
  Process control block
  <a class="heading-link" href="#process-control-block">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>To store and to keep track of all this information, a structure called Process Control Block (PCB) is used by the operating system. PCB is used by operating system to switch between 2 process in a multitasking operating system. Structure of process control block depends on the implementation by the operating system and may vary from one kernel to another, but it usually contains all the information from the process context from above, along with the following details.</p>
<ol>
<li>Process state</li>
<li>CPU registers state i.e. data stored in each CPU register during execution</li>
<li>CPU Scheduling information, i.e., the scheduling parameters such as pointers to scheduling queue to switch to another process.</li>
<li>Memory management information, including details for base and limit registers to help with address resolution  required to load the process in memory.</li>
<li>Input/Output status</li>
<li>Process status information i.e., CPU usage, memory usage, running time, process ID etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="process-states">
  Process States
  <a class="heading-link" href="#process-states">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>A process can be in any of the following five states.</p>
<ol>
<li>New</li>
<li>Ready</li>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Waiting</li>
<li>Stopped/Terminated</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://theknowledgeseeker.in/posts/images/process-states.png" alt="process-states"></p>
<p>But why does a process have to be in five states? A process should be either in running or stopped state, right? A process once loaded, terminates when all the instructions are executed. Let&rsquo;s understand what other states of process mean.</p>
<p>In a multitasking operating system, two or more process shares the computing resources and processes are interrupted mid execution to execute another process (depending on the scheduling policies and to keep CPU usage optimal) and the state of these processes are updated.</p>
<p>Thus, all process to be executed are registered as <strong>new state</strong> before they are added to the <strong>ready queue</strong> which includes the process to be executed by CPU. <strong>Running state</strong> processes are the ones that are being executed by CPU. The processes waiting for any I/O or event, are put in <strong>waiting queue</strong> which returns to the ready queue once the event completes. The process once completed are <strong>terminated</strong> by operating system.</p>
<p>The waiting queue is useful for I/O bound processes, to optimally use CPU on other process while the I/O bound process is handled by device controllers (such as hard disk) and triggers the completion of event, returning the process back to ready state.</p>
<h3 id="process-scheduling">
  Process Scheduling
  <a class="heading-link" href="#process-scheduling">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>The process are moved from one state to another by schedulers. Operating system have different types of schedulers used for process management.</p>
<h4 id="long-term-scheduler">
  Long Term Scheduler
  <a class="heading-link" href="#long-term-scheduler">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>The job scheduler or long-term scheduler selects processes from the storage pool (new state) and loads them into memory for execution (ready queue). The job scheduler must select a careful mixture of I/O bound and CPU bound processes to yield optimum system throughput. If it selects too many CPU bound processes then the I/O devices are idle and if it selects too many I/O bound processes then the processor has nothing to do.</p>
<h4 id="medium-term-scheduler">
  Medium Term Scheduler
  <a class="heading-link" href="#medium-term-scheduler">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Medium term scheduler is responsible for moving process between running state and waiting state. It loads in and out the process from memory when a process is moved to ready state and removed from running state respectively.</p>
<h4 id="short-term-scheduler">
  Short Term Scheduler
  <a class="heading-link" href="#short-term-scheduler">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>Short term scheduler moves the process from ready state into running state.</p>
<h4 id="context-switching">
  Context Switching
  <a class="heading-link" href="#context-switching">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h4>
<p>When one process is replaced by another process from the memory to be executed by CPU, it is known as context switching. The whole procedure saves the context of one state in its PCB and loads the context (details) from PCB of another process, which is done by <strong>dispatcher</strong>.</p>
<br />
<hr>
<p>Some backstory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What defines the criteria/policy operating system should use to schedule the processes?</strong></p>
<p>This is a question asked from me at an interview, to which I replied, &ldquo;process scheduling is dependent on the policy and the type of tasks system encounter so that the tasks that demands more attention can be given enough processing time&rdquo; providing example of how humans cook and manage multiple tasks. Later I realized, the answer could be more accurater. Humans cook and perform multiple task simultaneously based on the task at hand, provide different span of attention, but the one and only criteria is always to optimize the performance. So, Operating system choose the policy, which keeps your CPU as busy as possible. We wouldn&rsquo;t want our CPU to sit idle with so many task pending, right.</p>
