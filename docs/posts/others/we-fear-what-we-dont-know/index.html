        <p>You might all know, that there was an era when people do shitty  ceremonies to praise their gods like sacrificing and all. And you must  be thinking, only a fool can think so. Then you are wrong, everyone  including you and me, are fool enough to do same shitty things when it  comes to thing that we don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p>Confused?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not any theory, but one thing that I believe might be the reason.</p>
<p>Like all, humans when confronted a new technology, disease or anything else. The first thing they will feel fear, mainly because if something is  foreign to them, we can&rsquo;t just trust it unless we understand it.</p>
<p>What do you think, cavemen have reacted when fire was invented (may be  mistakenly). They must have feared it, yet curious enough to give it a  try, get themselves hurt by burning. And with time, they get along with  its properties and used it for their benefits. That&rsquo;s how use of fire  must have evolved.</p>
<p>Similarly, like me, there are other  people, who know new technology for encryption exists but never used it  and don&rsquo;t know why? Here&rsquo;s the reason, you haven&rsquo;t done your homework.  Once we get along a technology, its functioning, working, concepts  behind it and whether it&rsquo;s useful to you or not, we can start to use. Or we can just take a risk of trying something and see what&rsquo;s happen.  (which I believe the other type of people do)</p>

<p>Adding,</p>
<p>reading rich dad poor dad, in jan, 2020, it is only risky if we don&rsquo;t know what we are doing.</p>
<p>I am glad, that I realised about these principles of life so soon in my life. but sadly, as we grow, we tend to forget the basic and important things which would make our life a lot easier.</p>
