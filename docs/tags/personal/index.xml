      <description>This blog post contains total garbage and feel free to skip or close the tab anytime you want.
I always wanted to write blogs and share my thoughts with others but never got the courage to write blogs, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, maybe I am too much of paranoid or lazy or too chicken to try something new(which I am improvising by trying everything I can), on what people might think, how would they judge me.</description>
