      <description>Now, I am proud to be an hacker, especially knowing after how this hacker culture developed. Well, I am a part of a revolution, Hacker Revolution and I am very excited to be its part.
We had this session on an IRC channel #dgplug, which is a part of their summer training programme, and seriously what a great session it was. I still feel pumped up as if I was there by myself.</description>

      <description>Today, I attended my very first meetup PyDelhi. So I am going to share my experience about the meetup with you all.
Since it’s going to be my very first meetup, I was really excited for this to be happen. I woke up early to reach there on time and voila, like everything, we want nothing goes wrong with, and then there it is, boom. I got late, I don’t know how but on reaching the venue I found I was much early.</description>
